# zm-Negative correlation ensemble CNN for code smell detection
#Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets required for our research, which focuses on detecting code smells using a homogenous ensemble CNN model with negative correlation learning. Our study specifically targets the following common types of code smells: God Class, Feature Envy, Data Class, and Long Method. These smell types are chosen as they frequently occur and have been extensively studied in prior research.
